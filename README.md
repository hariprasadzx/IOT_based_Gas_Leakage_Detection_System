# IOT_based_Gas_Leakage_Detection_System
This project is about detecting gas leaks and automatically closing down the gas valve whenever one is discovered. When a gas leak is detected, the sensor's output is transmitted to the Arduino UNO, the buzzer is activated, the information is shown on the LCD display, and the stepper motor rotates to 90-degrees to lock the gas regulator The gas sensor also provides a signal to the NodeMCU. It sends an alert email to the user about the gas leak using the IFTTT server.
